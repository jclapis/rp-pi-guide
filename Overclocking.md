Hello everyone! 
The Raspberry Pi is now officially supported by Rocket Pool, so this guide is no longer necessary.
I've rolled it into the existing documentation, which you can find here:

[https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/)

(Specifically, you can start with [this section](https://docs.rocketpool.net/guides/node/local/prepare-pi.html) which should look quite familiar!)
