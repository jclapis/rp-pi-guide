# Running Rocket Pool with Docker

You've made it! You have a Pi, it's all set up, and you're ready to finally install Rocket Pool.
This guide is going to show you how to do it the "easy" way, using Docker.
This is the way Rocket Pool was originally meant to run, and it's the most supported configuration.

**NOTE: With all of that said, none of the ETH2 client vendors provide Docker images for ARM.
I had to build them myself, and had to modify the Rocket Pool installer to point to my images.
If you don't trust me, my installer script, or those Docker images, then you should stop here and learn how to build all of that for yourself from source so you can guarantee that they're safe.**

## Installing Rocket Pool

Okay, so as I said in the [Preparing Ubuntu for Rocket Pool](Preparing-the-OS.md) section, Docker is definitely the easiest way to use Rocket Pool.
Let me show you what I mean.

Start by pulling [my installer script from GitHub](https://github.com/jclapis/smartnode-install/releases/tag/v0.0.9-j1).
This is based on the regular Rocket Pool installer script, but I modified it a little so it pulls my Raspberry Pi-specific configuration.
Feel free to browse through it before actually running it.

Go to your home directory:
```
$ cd ~
```

Download my installer script:
```
$ wget https://github.com/jclapis/smartnode-install/releases/download/v0.0.9-j1/install-arm64.sh
```

Make it executable, so you can run it:
```
$ chmod +x install-arm64.sh
```

Finally, run it:
```
$ ./install-arm64.sh
```

This is going to install a bunch of necessary things for you, like Docker and Docker Compose.
After that, it will download my configuration bundle for Rocket Pool and put it into `~/.rocketpool/`.
Lastly, it will download the Rocket Pool command line interface (CLI), which is the interactive program you use to run Rocket Pool.

The last few steps should look like this:
```
Step 4 of 8: Adding user to docker group...
Step 5 of 8: Creating Rocket Pool user data directory...
Step 6 of 8: Downloading Rocket Pool package files...
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100   651  100   651    0     0   3271      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  3271
100 7845k  100 7845k    0     0  5689k      0  0:00:01  0:00:01 --:--:-- 10.2M
Step 7 of 8: Copying package files to Rocket Pool user data directory...
Step 8 of 8: Installing Rocket Pool CLI...
```

It will take a while, but if all of those steps complete without throwing any errors, then Rocket Pool will be installed.

The last thing to do, and **this is important**, is you need to *log out* if you're using a desktop UI, or *exit* if you're using SSH.
You need to do this in order to be able to use Docker properly, because it set some permissions on your user account that won't apply until you log out and log back in / start a new session.

Once you log back in / reconnect, you're all set.


## Configuring Rocket Pool

Now that it's installed, it's time to configure Rocket Pool.
Normally this means picking your ETH1 client, your ETH2 client, and setting a few extra things like the graffiti you get to display when you propose new blocks.
This is still the case for the Pi, but we have to do a few extra things to make it all come together.


### Choosing the ETH1 and ETH2 Client

Start by running the normal Rocket Pool configuration process:
```
$ rocketpool service config
```

The first thing it will do is ask you which ETH 1.0 client you want. Press `1` for `Geth`, and hit `enter`.
It will ask you some other questions about EthStats, but you can leave them blank - just press `enter`.

Next, it will ask you if you want to use a random ETH 2.0 client. Press `n` for NO.
Your screen should look like this:
```
Geth Eth 1.0 client selected.

Please enter the Ethstats Label (leave blank for none)
(optional - for reporting Eth 1.0 node status to ethstats.net)


Please enter the Ethstats Login (leave blank for none)
(optional - for reporting Eth 1.0 node status to ethstats.net)


Would you like to run a random Eth 2.0 client (recommended)? [y/n]
n
```

Next you'll be presented with your choice of the ETH 2.0 clients.
**This is very important. I've done a bunch of testing with each of them, and I strongly, STRONGLY recommend that you use Nimbus for Raspberry Pi setups.**
Nimbus uses about **1/10th the RAM** of the other clients which makes it ideal for our little computer.
It also comes with **doppelganger protection**, which means it will check the network to see if your validator is already in use - if it is, it won't do any more attestations.
In other words, you won't get slashed for running two nodes with the same keys. Nice!

Anyway, when you are asked which ETH 2.0 client to use, press `4` for Nimbus.

After that, you'll be asked for some custom graffiti.
This is a short message that will be added to any blocks you propose, for the whole world to see.
Pick something fun or something personal to you.
I set mine to `Made on a RPi 4!`, as you can see below:
```
4

Nimbus Eth 2.0 client selected.

Please enter the Custom Graffiti (leave blank for none)
(optional - for adding custom text to signed Eth 2.0 blocks - 16 chars max)
Made on a RPi 4!
```

Feel free to use that so everyone knows you're validating on a Pi, or pick whatever else you want.
You can also just leave it blank if you don't want to say anything in your blocks.

Once you're done with that, you'll see this message:
```
Done! Run 'rocketpool service start' to apply new configuration settings.
```

**DON'T DO THAT.** We need to do some extra configuration first before running Rocket Pool.


### Configuring Geth

The first thing to do is change some of the properties that Geth launches with.
By default, it will use a lot of RAM and connect to a lot of peers.
We don't want either of those things - we want low RAM because, well, we're on a Pi.
We don't want a lot of peers because we're not going to do a whole lot with ETH1, and don't need to waste the extra connections.

Run `nano` on the ETH1 launch script to edit it, like you edited `/etc/fstab` in the previous section:
```
$ nano ~/.rocketpool/chains/eth1/start-node.sh
```

This is the script that controls what command line arguments Geth will get launched with.

Change the `CMD=...` string on line 8 by adding the `--cache 256` and `--maxpeers 24` arguments right after `/usr/local/bin/geth`.
The former will make Geth use way less RAM than it normally does.
The latter will limit Geth to 24 peers. The default is 50, and you can set this to a higher or lower number if you want, but 24 works for me.

The final string should look like this (where the `...` just means there's more stuff afterwards):

```
    CMD="/usr/local/bin/geth --cache 256 --maxpeers 24 --goerli --datadir /ethclient/geth ...
```

Once that's done, save it with `Ctrl+O` and exit with `Ctrl+X`.


### Configuring the Default Docker Location

By default, Docker is going to store all of its image data on your operating system drive.
This means the microSD card.
Clearly, that's not what we want - we want it all to live on the SSD that you just spent all that time setting up!

To do this, create a new file called `/etc/docker/daemon.json` as the root user:

```
$ sudo nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

This will be empty at first, which is fine. Add this as the contents:
```
{
    "data-root": "/mnt/rpdata/docker"
}
```

where `/mnt/rpdata` refers to the mount point of the SSD you set up in the previous section, and `docker` refers to the folder where Docker will store all of its data. I just called it `docker`, but you can call it whatever you want.

Save and exit with `Ctrl+O` and `Ctrl+X`. 

Now, restart the docker daemon so it picks up on the changes:
```
$ sudo systemctl restart docker
```

After that, you should be all set!


## Starting Rocket Pool

And with that, Rocket Pool is finally installed and ready to start. 
Go ahead and kick it off:

```
$ rocketpool service start
```

It will download the ARM Docker images I made for Geth, Nimbus, and the Rocket Pool smartnode.
Once they're downloaded, it will kick them all off.
You should see this at the end:
```
Starting rocketpool_eth1 ... done
Starting rocketpool_api  ... done
Starting rocketpool_eth2 ... done
Starting rocketpool_watchtower ... done
Starting rocketpool_node       ... done
Starting rocketpool_validator  ... done
```

That means all of the images are running.

To check on Geth and make sure it's working, do this:
```
$ rocketpool service logs eth1
```

You should start seeing lots of lines that look like this:
```
eth1_1        | INFO [02-21|05:25:55.310] Imported new block receipts              count=2048 elapsed=9.204s      number=1003853 hash="7c0afcÂ…014aa7" age=1y7mo6d  size=2.75MiB
eth1_1        | INFO [02-21|05:25:57.596] Imported new state entries               count=0    elapsed=2.579s      processed=4208370 pending=8305  trieretry=39  coderetry=0  duplicate=0 unexpected=40787
```

That means geth is currently syncing.
When you see a line that has `Imported new block receipts` at the start, the `age` at the end of the line (`age=1y7mo6d` in the above example) shows you how far away the block you're currently on is.
Once the age gets to 0, you're all synced.

You can do the same for Nimbus with this command:
```
$ rocketpool service logs eth2
```

Nimbus will print lines like this:
```
eth2_1        | INF 2021-02-21 06:35:43.302+00:00 Slot start                                 topics="beacnde" tid=1 file=nimbus_beacon_node.nim:940 lastSlot=682377 scheduledSlot=682378 delay=302ms641us581ns peers=47 head=f752f69a:745 headEpoch=23 finalized=2717f624:672 finalizedEpoch=21 sync="PPUPPPDDDD:10:2.0208:1.5333:05d03h29m (736)"
eth2_1        | INF 2021-02-21 06:35:43.568+00:00 Slot end
```

Here's how to read this:
- The `lastSlot=682377` tells you what the latest block in the network really is
- The number in parentheses at the end (`(736)`) tells you which block you're currently on
- The `peers=47` tells you how many peers you're currently connected to
- The time towards the end (`05d03h29m`) tells you how long Nimbus thinks it will be until you're fully synced

This will be a little slow at first as you accumulate peers and as Geth syncs in parallel.
Once Geth is synced and stops chewing up all the SSD's I/O, this will speed up.


By default, Nimbus will try to connect to a maximum of 160 peers.
If you want to speed that up, you can **open up a port in your router's port forwarding setup**.
Tell it to forward **port 9001** on both TCP and UDP to your Pi's IP address - this way, other ETH2 clients can discover it from the outside.
Each router has a different way of doing this, so you'll need to check out your router's manual on how it does port forwarding.

You can also do this for Geth if you want to speed up your ETH1 sync - just forward **port 30303** for both TCP and UDP as well.


## Using and Monitoring Rocket Pool

At this point, you have a working instance of Rocket Pool running on your Pi!
Congratulations! You worked hard to get this far, so take a few minutes to celebrate.
Once you're back, let's talk about how to actually use Rocket Pool and monitor how things are going.


### Setting up a Validator

With respect to using it, Rocket Pool developer Jake Pospischil has written up [a wonderful guide on exactly this](https://medium.com/rocket-pool/rocket-pool-v2-5-beta-node-operators-guide-77859891766b) already.
It also covers installing Rocket Pool, but that's for boring old normal computers... you already did that whole process!
Anyway, to learn how to use Rocket Pool for validating on ETH2, take a look at the guide linked above and skip about halfway down the page, to the section labeled **Registering Your Node**.
That will walk you through the ins-and-outs of how to create a validator with Rocket Pool.


### Monitoring your Pi's Performance

In terms of monitoring things, you already saw how to look at the logs for Geth and Nimbus by using:
- `$ rocketpool service logs eth1`
- `$ rocketpool service logs eth2`

These commands are what you'll use to keep an eye on their respective performances.

You've also seen `htop`, which gives you a nice live view into your system resources:
```
$ htop
```
![](images/Htop.png)

On the top display with the bars, `Mem` shows you how much RAM you're currently using (and how much you have left).
`Swp` shows you how much swap space you're using, and how much is left.

On the bottom table, each row represents a process.
Geth and Nimbus will probably be on top, which you can see in the rightmost column labeled `Command`.
The `RES` column shows you how much RAM each process is taking - in this screenshot, Geth is taking 748 MB and Nimbus is taking 383 MB.
The `CPU%` column shows you how much CPU power each process is consuming.
100% represents a single core, so if it's over 100%, that means it's using a lot from multiple cores (like Geth is here, with 213%).

If you want to track how much network I/O your system uses over time, you can install a nice utility called `vnstat`:
```
$ sudo apt install vnstat
```

To run it, do this:
```
$ vnstat -i eth0
```

This won't work right away because it needs time to collect data about your system, but as the days and weeks pass, it will end up looking like this:

```
$ vnstat -i eth0

     ------------------------+-------------+-------------+---------------
     estimated     11.35 GiB |   15.27 GiB |   26.62 GiB |
```

This will let you keep tabs on your total network usage, which might be helpful if your ISP imposes a data cap.

Finally, and most importantly, use a block explorer like [Beaconcha.in](https://pyrmont.beaconcha.in) to watch your validator's attestation performance and income.
If everything is set up right, you should see something like this:
![](images/Beaconchain.png)

All of the attestations should say `Attested` for their **Status**, and ideally all of the **Opt. Incl. Dist.** should be 0 (though an occasional 1 or 2 is fine).

And that's all there is to it! Congratulations again, and enjoy validating with your Raspberry Pi!
